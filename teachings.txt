// learning react // 

// you can use <> and </> tags to return elements from React functions
because in react you can only return one element, which can be an element that 
contains many elements. 

if you don't want a div you can use <> </> tags

// capital letters for React components

// import react statements come with every react component but you do not need them anymore

// insert component from another file with <filename /> like an xml tag 

you can pass props in functions and set default props

prop types make your code more robust
